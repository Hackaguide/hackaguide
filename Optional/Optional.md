- **Attendee Entitlement**  
	This is fairly controversial, cover the basics first.
	<br>  
	The easiest introduction to this topic is having MLH Coaches to various hackathons.  Once introduced, many people never considered the cost of bailing out of it last minute and never showed.  Despite measures taken to let hackers know that such decisions had a financial cost and reduce attrition - not much progress were made.  Thus when coaches to various hackathons were killed, there was a huge outcry as precedent had been set and people 'expected' it to be there.

	Similarly this applies to swag.


- **Regulating Restocks**  
	Tricky subject, you've ordered food for your attendees but also provide snacks to them.  Do you regulate snacks so that your meals don't go to waste or do you let attendees self-regulate their own eating habits?  

	Much of this is down to personal choice, 
		
		- Restock less an hour before meals
		- No restock during and an hour after meals

	It might be a good idea to poll a friend you know who is hacking and ask them to give you honest feedback on how they feel about the release of snacks and foods. Whilst this is not representative of everyone, it gives you some idea about how hungry hackers are and you may wish to adjust the amount you are releasing.
