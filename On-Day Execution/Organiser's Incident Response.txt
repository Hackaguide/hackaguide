The following is a guide of actions to be taken in response to a Code of Conduct or Rules violation

1) Detailed written account of the incident, ideally by the reporter.  If not, transcribe the incident as describe to you with as much detail as possible.  The incident must then be signed and dated.

Crucial information to be gathered:
- Identifying information (name, contact) of the person in violation
- Behaviour that caused violation
- Approximate time of incident (if different from time of report)
- Circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people who are involved in or witnessed the incident
- Other people who know of the incident

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU:
- Never ask if they want it to be escalated or allow them to withdraw the complaint
- Never ask for victim's advice on how to deal with incident.
- Never ask for victim's advice on penalties or actions to be taken.
- Never ask "How can I help you feel better"

2) Guidelines Post-Incident Report:
- Immediately inform an organiser(s) or person(s)-in-charge
- Offer the victom a private place to sit
- Ask "Is there a friend or trusted person who you would like to be with you?", (If so, arrange for someone to notify this person)
- Provide them an organiser point of contact, allowing them to receive help at a later date if necessary

Involving the police:
- General threat to participants, or safety of anyone is in doubt, contact the police immediately
- If everyone present is physically safe, involve the police at the victim's request.

3) Communicating with alleged harasser
- Inform them of what has been reported about them
- Allow them to give their side of the story to the organisers

Should the report stand, let the alleged harasser know that actions will be taken against them.

These actions include:
- Warning the harasser to cease such behaviour and further reports will result in sanctions
- Requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and any physical proximity to their victim at the event.
- Ending any volunteer responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds
- Requiring the harasser to immediately leave the premises and not return.
- Banning the harasser from any future volunteering events with regards to U-18s
- Publishing an account of the harassment
- Give the accused a place to appeal if possible, but in the meantime the report stands.  DO NOT encourage an apology from the harasser.
