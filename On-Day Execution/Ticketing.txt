/********Check-In********/
- Multiple tables for registration

		- General attendees
		- Sponsors

		- Vegetarians, Vegans, Halal

		- Under-18s
	- They must be worn IMMEDIATELY and not taken off until leaving the event
- Security
	- If you have staff marked as Security (ID'ed via High-Vis jackets or otherwise), worth having them at Registration to manage the queue + deal with potential troublemakers.
- Direct attendees to the Opening Ceremony (have signs to guide as well!)


/********Waitlist********/
- If people without tickets would like to come:
	- Ensure attendees with tickets have priority
	- Unless attrition is extremely high, 20 mins before the Opening Ceremony is a good time to open up spaces to those waiting.
