Attendee Dietary Requirements

- Compare list of checked-in attendees against original attendee list
	- Account for the various allergies and dietary requirements.  This way you know how much to order if you are buying meals on-day for them .

Mealtime Release
---

The following should have been decided upon by the food team and communicated to the rest of the volunteers:
- Communicating to attendees how food will be released
- Food release system
- If volunteers are distributing portions
- Wristband Identification:
	- X Color for Vegetarians, Vegans, Halal, Kosher
	- Various other colors or one color for Lactose Intolerant, Gluten-Free and allergies.


---
Restocking Schedule
---

- Should have been decided at this point, adjust as required
- Keep a running inventory of what has been released and let the organisers know if more needs to be purchased
	- This is where having a list of stores / wholesalers near you and their opening & closing times will come in handy.
	- Certain items (milk, other perishables) can be bought just in time for meals.

Rubbish Collection

Being done every hour or two, maybe as needed?  Can be done by volunteers assigned to that specific area, or by the food team.
