# Ticketing

### Check-In

- Multiple tables for registration
- Should be in a central, accessible location
- Physical Identification
	- Ensure that the names on IDs match the name on the tickets.
		- Security to deal with those that don't.	
	- Ensure different colored wristbands / lanyards to cover the following:
		- General attendees
		- Sponsors
		- Volunteers
		- DBS-Checked Volunteers
		- Vegetarians, Vegans, Halal
		- Lactose Intolerant, Gluten-Free and allergies.
		- Under-18s
	- They must be worn IMMEDIATELY and not taken off until leaving the event
- Security
	- If you have staff marked as Security (ID'ed via High-Visibility jackets or otherwise), worth having them at Registration to manage the queue + deal with potential troublemakers.
- Direct attendees to the Opening Ceremony (have signs to guide as well!)


### Waitlist

- If people without tickets would like to come:
	- Ensure attendees with tickets have priority
	- May or may not be a good idea, as people who initially got tickets will feel as if they should not have tried to get tickets anyway.
	- 20 mins before the Opening Ceremony is a good time to open up spaces to those waiting.  However, if attrition is extremely high, you may want to open up spaces long before that.
