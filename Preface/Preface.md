So you'd like to hold a hackathon!  Thats a huge step and we'd like to welcome you to the wonderous world of hackathon organising and managing organised chaos.  This guide should hopefully cover the issues you'll need to tackle while organising a hackathon.  It's split into the following segments:

- Preface (You're reading it!)
- Pre-Planning
	- This is a fairly lengthy read, but please don't be intimidated by it.  Much of the text is to give you an idea of the various choices available and reasons why you would want to pick one over the others.  
	- Segmented by topic for easy reference, feel free to skip to specific chapters as you require.
- On-Day Execution
	- A more concise version of Pre-Planning
	- The topics here duplicate Pre-Planning **but** assume you've read the same chapter in Pre-Planning.  The focus here will be on operations during the event and executing / implementing decisions you've made during Pre-Planning.
- Post-Event
	- Things you'll want to do after your event is done
- Optional
	- Stuff that you **shouldn't** approach until you're confident that you've covered the essentials / core.  This stuff can be woolly, headache-worthy and occassionally raise your internal caffeine pressure sky-high.  *Approach with caution.*


Let us repeat again: Hackathon Organising isn't too difficult, have fun and enjoy yourself while doing it.  This guide is long but mainly because we wanted to cover as much detail as possible to make life easy for ya'll!  We hope you have as much fun running a hackathon as we had running ours!
