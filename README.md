# Preface

So you'd like to organize a hackathon!  That's a huge step and we'd like to welcome you to the wonderous world of hackathon organising and managing organised chaos.  We all organize hackathons for different reasons.  While bigger and better seems appealing - so is the joy of building a community that facilitates the meeting of like-minded people to share ideas and build awesome projects!  That reason will influence some of the key decisions you will make while organizing the event!

This guide should cover many of the issues you'll face before, during and after the hackathon.  We're attempting to document the many options available to you and often will highlight one option.  Do not construe this as that option being better than others.  The guide is split into the following segments:

- Preface (You're here aren't you?)
- Pre-Planning
	- This is a lengthy read, but please don't be intimidated by it.  Much of the content is to give you an idea of the various choices available and reasons why you would want to pick one over the others.  
	- Segmented by topic for easy reference, feel free to skip to specific chapters as you require.
- On-Day Execution
	- A more concise version of Pre-Planning
	- The topics here duplicate Pre-Planning **but** assume you've read the same chapter in Pre-Planning.  The focus here will be on operations during the event and executing / implementing decisions you've made during Pre-Planning.
- Post-Event
	- Things you'll want to do after your event is done
- Optional
	- Stuff that you **shouldn't** approach until you're confident that you've covered the essentials / core.  This stuff can be woolly, headache-worthy and occassionally raise your internal caffeine pressure sky-high.  *Approach with significant caution.*


Let us repeat again: Hackathon Organising isn't too difficult, have fun and enjoy yourself while doing it.  This guide is long but mainly because we wanted to cover as much detail as possible to make life easy for our lovely readers!  We hope you have as much fun running a hackathon as we had running ours!

PS: Feel free to make a pull request to this repo if you feel we've missed anything out!

# Attendee Communication

How do you let your attendees know what they need to be aware of before / during the event?  With all the events and workshops happening, you'll want attendees to be aware of what's going on.  This can be done during Pre-Event and On-day, we've included some of the possible methods you might want to consider below.


### Email Updates

Good way to keep interest about the event going.  Regular weekly emails can have information like:
  - When the next batch of tickets is coming out (if using First-Come-First-Served ticketing)
  - Reminders to cancel tickets if attendees can't make it
  - Information about the hackathon (Sponsors, Welcome Pack etc)
  - Emphasising the venue might be cold and bringing *thick* layers is helpful
  - Information / Resources for those first-time hackathon attendees.
  - Reminder about Code of Conduct


### Welcome Pack

The information pack you have for your participants!  This will be really helpful in letting your attendees know what to expect beforehand.  It also conveniently centralises information for your attendees.  Information you may like to put in the Welcome Pack include:
	- Venue-related: Floor plans, fire exits, building access and how to get to the venue
	- Overall Schedule
	- Workshop / Events Specific Schedule
	- Wifi Details
	- Food Menu and Meal Times
	- Challenges
	- Sponsors
	- Prizes

Things worth noting:

- How you make your Welcome Pack available is important!  Ways to deliver include:
  - PDF on website
  - Printed out booklet on day (Budget-dependent)
- If the Welcome Pack is available on your website, be ready to quickly upload the edited Welcome Pack.  You don't want attendees missing out on workshops / events they want to attend.
- Attendees sometimes forget to list down their food intolerances / allergies.  Being able to see the food menu makes them more likely to reach out and let you know beforehand.


### Volunteer Helpdesk

Plan to setup a Volunteer Helpdesk at an easily accessible location in your event.  The Helpdesk should be the main point of contact between Organisers, Volunteers, Sponsors and Attendees.  Aware of what's going on in the hackathon the helpdesk's responsibilities include:
	- Answering questions on Slack, Social Media (Facebook, Twitter)
	- Answering questions on-site	
	- Directing people to the right mentors and vice-versa.
	- Making announcements on Slack for food, workshops, activities etc.

Having a dedicated team for handling such communications helps reduce redundancy and allows other volunteers to focus on their specific roles.  However do ensure the rest of the team knows what's going on.


### Volunteers

You and your volunteers will be engaging with the attendees throughout the event, for more details check out the [Volunteer Section](kpchi.github.io/hackaguide/Volunteers.html "Volunteer Section").


### Slack

Ahhh, the ubiquitous Slack.  For the uninitiated, Slack is a messaging and collaboration system for teams.  Its many service integrations can be helpful for a variety of reasons such as:
	- Announcements for food, workshops / mini-events / talks and other cool stuff.
	- Event-specific bot created specifically to answer questions like where different rooms are, sponsor challenges and schedule amongst others. [1]
	- Sponsor-specific channels.  Discussions, Q&A, sponsor specific announcements can all be done here.
	- Spotify Integration?  If you've got a Spotify playlist playing, attendees can add tracks to it.  (Make sure the music doesn't breach your Code of Conduct though)

While nothing really beats on-day human interaction, Slack is a good way to get pre-Event hype going.  By inviting attendees and sponsors onto the Event Slack early on, everyone can talk to each other and get to know more about the event, its sponsors etc.


### Signage

You've definitely been annoyed at unclear, confusing signs before.  So how else do you ensure attendees know where to go?  Places like the food area, hacking spaces, talks / events or sleeping rooms - **clear** directions to getting there are important.  Nothing is more frustrating than being lost in an unfamiliar environment.

- Scout your venue and get an estimate of how many signs need to be printed and where they can be placed
- When printing signs:
	- Make sure the signs are frequent enough so people aren't lost.
	- Check if the venue's walls can be easily damaged by sticky-tape / blu-tack.
	- Ensure large prints and simple fonts so they can be easily spotted from afar.


### Announcements

- Is there a Public Announcement System in the venue?
	- Microphones - Wired / Wireless?
	- Does the PA System reach throughout the hacking spaces?

# Food

**ASSUMPTION**: 24 Hour hackathon, starting Saturday Morning and ending Sunday evening.

- Saturday: Breakfast (Optional, good to have)  
- Saturday: Lunch  
- Saturday: Dinner  
- Sunday  : Midnight Meal  
- Sunday  : Breakfast  
- Sunday  : Lunch

Things worth noting:  

- Don't be afraid to experiment!  Yes some foods can be hit and miss, but it's worth going beyond just the usual local norms like pizza, burritos, noodles, pies etc.
- List all the tasty food you are providing on the Attendee Welcome Pack!  Hackers are more likely to let you know about their allergies!
- Don't load up on just carbs, hackers are humans too!  Be nice and provide some healthy, nutritious food to sustain them.
- Make sure the food team has accounted for the various dietary requirements and allergies!  People doing ticketing should talk to the food team.
	- Various allergies (Especially peanut)
	- Halal, Kosher
	- Vegetarian, Vegan
	- Lactose Intolerant
	- Gluten-Free
- Make sure you have a list of stores / wholesalers near you, their opening & closing times and what they stock!  This is really helpful for restocking or buying meals for attendees with dietary requirements.  If you have a low number of them, someone could easily head out to purchase such food.


### Mealtime Release

Ahh the sight of a hungry horde of hackers going for food is often an intimidating one.  How do you release food ensuring attendees don't queue too long for food? Or making sure everyone has their fair share?  A hungry hacker = grumpy hacker!

To that effect, the batch release system usually works well.  Determining a batch size (range of table numbers, hackspace location or some other automagical way), and reducing that to a manageable number is up to you!  Below is an example you might find useful, but use what works for you!

- Sponsors, Guest Judges first (before specified meal time begins)
- Call the batch!  Make sure the volunteers know the wristband identification system, allowing them to direct attendees with allergies or dietary requirements to the right section.
- Wait (X) Minutes before calling the next batch
- Repeat the last 2 steps until all attendees have gotten food
- Finally, Volunteers grab food
- Release for seconds to everyone if there is spare.

- Consider having volunteers distributing the portions, instead of attendees taking as much as they want.

- Wristband Identification:
	- X Color for Vegetarians, Vegans, Halal
	- Various other colors or one color for Lactose Intolerant, Gluten-Free and allergies.

- Consider keeping non-vegetarian and vegetarian options separate.

- Have labels in front of the food describing it.  This reduces any confusion attendees might have and volunteers won't have to repeatedly answer the same question.


### Snacks & Drinks

And here come the nibbles and elixirs of life that keep hackers sustained when all else has passed.  Hackers need energy to sustain when they're working and staying up all-night, so remember to get high-energy items!  But that doesn't mean only providing Redbull, there are high-energy fruits as well like bananas and pears.  Below is a list of things you can consider.

- Snacks
	- Fruits (Bananas, Apples, Pears, Tangerines)
	- Granola Bars
	- Nuts
	- Candy (Gummy Bears, Lollipops, Mars Bars and the like)
	- Crisps
	- Biscuits

- Drinks
	- Convenience here is key
	- Soda cans rather than 1.5L bottles with cups
	- Redbull (See [Sponsors Section](kpchi.github.io/hackaguide/Pre-Planning/Sponsors "Sponsors")) / Energy Drink
	- Water bottles (500ml)
	- Coffee, Tea, Hot Chocolate
	- Milk (Dairy and Soy)

- Method of Delivery
	- Snacks available at fixed locations
		- Requires regular restocking (see [Restocking Schedule](kpchi.github.io/hackaguide/Pre-Planning/Food.html#restocking-schedule "Restocking Schedule"))
		- No way to control how much each hacker takes (See [Optional](kpchi.github.io/hackaguide/Optional "Optional"))
	- Snacks available on regular rounds
		- Snacks go on rounds every so often
		- Possible that one or more carts required to prevent snacks that round from running out.
		- Volunteers can interact more with attendees!
	- Snacks available via KurtCart [Idea stolen from StudentHack]		
		- Essentially Delivery on Tweet.  Attendees can tweet at an account or with a hashtag, volunteers will come round with the snacks cart soon after. 
		- Requires tables to have fixed numbers + venue map with table numbers.
		- Requires for active social media monitoring and specific assigned volunteers.
		- Allows for a more joyful atmosphere with the feeling of a catered to service.  Also volunteers can interact more with attendees!

- Things worth noting:
	- Having a variety of food is nice to have if possible.
	- Add healthy snacks in like nuts, (dried) fruit or granola bars!  
	- Have water, lots of it.  Caffeine is fun and all, but it's also dehydrating.  And rather than let attendees get even more dehydrated by ingesting more, water always helps!
	- Have more than 1 kettle available if you're providing hot water / beverages / pot noodles.  


### Restocking Schedule

- Dependent on the method of delivery, fixed locations can be regularly restocked or restocked as required.  Regular rounds and the KurtCart can get restocked when the round is finished.
- Debate between regular restock and restocking as required, and regulating restocks.
	- **Budget dependent**, how much can you afford to release each restock and how much buffer budget do you have left?
	- **Regulating** before and after meals (See [Optional](kpchi.github.io/hackaguide/Optional "Optional"))

# Logistics

Much of the guide is fundamentally about event logistics. However some the points raised here don't immediately relate to their parent topic or don't fit into any topic.  Hence the reason for creating a catch-all logistics topic.


### Storage of Equipment / Food / Prizes
  - Clearly listing where stuff is stored
  - Tools / First Aid Kits and Equipment for re-supply


### Furniture
  - Seating Capacity + Floor Plan
  - Arrangement
  - Fire Code / Safety


### Power Supply

- 
- Mains Step-down?
- Generator
- Electrician support / SLA from venue if any 


### Pre-Event / Workshop Preparation

- Ensure mic / projector / required equipment working and ready for plug-n-play
- Setting up of furniture layout, making sure general cleanliness of area.
- 


### Venue Cleanliness

- Waste Management
  
  A necessity at hackathons, considering the consumables attendees go through during the entire event.  Tables have occasionally become a landfill just from Coke cans alone.

  It's worth doing them every hour or two, and make sure the bin bags you've purchased aren't too flimsy.  Having a mix of shudder-worthy contents spill all over you is a surefire way to spoil an otherwise good hackathon.

  Which is also a good reason to get hand sanitiser and disposable gloves!
    
- Toilet Maintenance


### Fire Safety

# Schedule

Having an overall event schedule is helpful, but be aware that delays *will* occur and you'll need to adjust for them.

### Event Schedule

This schedule provides information about what events / workshops are taking place at what time.  That is unless you're keeping it a surprise.  Below is a table of ways to make the event schedule available, ordered by update speed (fastest to slowest)

| Method of Delivery | Visibility | Update Speed |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Live Ticker (See [Optional](kpchi.github.io/hackaguide/Optional "Optional")) | If in central location, High | Faster |
| Website | High | Faster |
| Welcome Pack | Medium | Fast |
| Poster | High (until outdated) | Not possible |
| Welcome Booklet | High (until outdated) | Not possible |

Things worth Noting:
- Having a full event schedule and an event/workshop-only schedule can be useful.  Just remember both need to be updated!
- When planning your provisional schedule, add a small amount of buffer time.  This helps reduce the amount of adjusting you'll do on-day


### Volunteer Schedule

This is the full schedule where you'll detail what roles volunteers are assigned and where they should be. For more details, check out the [Volunteer Section](kpchi.github.io/hackaguide/Volunteers.html#Schedule "Volunteer Section").

# Sleeping Rooms

### Sleeping / Resting areas

Hackathons shouldn't be events of self-imposed torture (lack of sleep, post-hackathon illness, junk food overload etc).  So why not provide areas conducive to resting?  Here are some things to take note of:

- Do you have capacity for more than one sleeping rooms?  Do you have Under-18s present staying overnight?  If the answer to either is yes note:
	- Nice touch to have gender specific sleeping rooms
	- If Under-18s are present overnight, ensure they have separate sleeping rooms. Background-Checked Volunteers stationed outside Under-18 specific sleeping rooms
- Provide sleeping Bags / Yoga Mats / Air Beds (make sure you have an *electric* pump handy!) depending on your budget.  If not, asking attendees to bring their own is also a possibility. 
- Is it going to be cold during the event?
- Don't assume your sleeping areas will always be warm.
	- Ensure that room heating is active at night, and check if it adjustable or is controlled by central heating.
	- Provide or ask attendees to bring their own blankets.
	- Have portable heaters available (ensure it doesn't breach Fire Safety!  See [Venue](kpchi.github.io/hackaguide/Pre-Planning/Venue "Venue"))
- Air flow to introduce fresh air is important too!  Waking up to the sleeping room smelling like a locker room isn't always pleasant.

Beyond that, there are other things such as noise and light pollution as well as privacy to be aware of:

- Noise Pollution
	- Having heavy doors / curtains help block out some noise
	- Keep sleeping areas away from main hacking spaces
	- Avoid planning any mini-events near the sleeping area
	- Make sleeping rooms **Alarm-free Zones**.  Let attendees know, and have a sign up stating as such.
		- If you have manpower, vo

- Light Pollution
	- Be aware of where sunlight can stream in - having curtains over windows is ideal.
	- Makeshift curtains work just as well!  

- Privacy
	- You wouldn't like it if someone was able to peek into your bedroom while you were sleeping.  Similarly, you should ensure resting attendees have such privacy.
	- Space out how you lay the mats!  We all have differing levels of personal space, and it wouldn't be fun to roll into another person at night.

# Ticketing

Please note this guide is Eventbrite First-Come First-Served (FCFS)-centric, there are some theoretical aspects here worth taking note of.  See Debatable.

### Pre-registration

- To gain quick idea of interest before actually releasing tickets.
- Allows an idea on priority release for certain groups if needed.


### Ticket Release

ASSUMPTION: FCFS ticket style only via Eventbrite. See Alternative Methods for some other alternative ticketing methods.

- Release tickets about 6 weeks before the event
- Multiple small batches, this keeps up the hype
	- Keep a rotation of ticket releases:
		E.g.: Monday 1pm, Tuesday 3pm, Wednesday 4pm, Thursday 7pm, Friday 8pm.  This ensures the different segments are taken care of and people don't feel like they've been excluded.
	- Ticket releases are announced via the Mailing List - this ensures people sign up to the mailing list and increases the 'hook' for (potential) attendees to keep track of whats going on in the newsletter / Mailing List.
- Ensure that only 1 ticket can be purchased, not multiple at once.  Will be a nightmare for Registration if multiple purchases are allowed.  

- Below are some Custom Questions you might want to ask amongst others:
	- Any allergies, dietary requirements you need to be aware of?
	- Any special requirements? (Medical, Accessibility)
	- Are you Under-18? (This assumes you're allowing U-18s to participate)
	- Do you have access to EduRoam / {X University Network}
	- First-time hackathon attendee?

### Access Codes

- Usually meant to be for:
	- Beginners
	- Individuals from groups under-represented in technology
	- Those with special needs or requiring special accommodations
	- For University-specific groups
		- Keep an active eye out on universities with only 1 or 2 students attending.  Ask them if they have friends who would like to come and provide enough tickets for them to form a team.


### Waitlist

- Give people on the waitlist 24 hours to respond.
- 3 days before the event, it would be better to prioritise people local or close to your hackathon (low travel costs)
- Consider giving a ticket to attendees on the waitlist who email / message asking for a ticket as they're more likely to come.

NOTE: Eventbrite has a weird bug where tickets released to waitlisted people are claimed but not taken off the waitlist.


### Alternative Methods

- Type of ticket releases
	- First-Comme First-Served Ticketing

		Advantages:
		- Lowest barrier to entry of the 3 methods listed down.  Applicants simply log-on to Eventbrite at the specified time, purchase (a free) ticket and done.
		- Immediate and people can make plans straightaway
		- Using batch-based ticketing helps maintain the interest in the event
			- Also allows word to spread to non-insider groups.  However, this should be addressed during the initial batches to allow people traveling from afar to get cheap tickets.

		Disadvantages: 
		- Can become a case of who has the fastest internet speed / can click the fastest.
		- Unfriendly to disabled users, especially because of how fast tickets can go in FCFS.  Need to release tickets but without being seen to be 'targeting' them.
		- Effort required to cover all potential target audiences, i.e. rotating ticket releases

	- Randomized Pool

		Advantages:
		- Completely randomized from a pool
		- Usually for the university's own students

		Disadvantages:
		- Completely randomized from a pool
		- Needs to be done early to avoid attendees having to pay a high travel cost.

	- Applications

		Advantages:
		- For (softly) themed hackathons, if they're looking for people with experience in the field this will help narrow down to attendees with experience.
		- Helps successful applicants get jobs with companies
			- Their CV's / emails are sent out to sponsoring companies
			- Part of the recruitment clause in the sponsorship package
			- Applicants should be aware of this fact (Ethical issue: Data Privacy) 
		
		Disadvantages:
		- High barrier to entry.
			- Daunting to first-timers / beginners especially if they feel that they're disadvantaged for not having a CV / LinkedIn / GitHub
			- Questionable as to why are these questions (GitHub handle / LinkedIn / CV) required?   Organizers need to be upfront about what they are using this data for.  Sponsorship, recruitment or?
			- Note that having such information is not a substitute for on-day interaction with hackers.  But better than blanket recruitment emails where the click-in rate is low.
		- Especially for beginners or people without any programming experience, they will feel "they're not good enough"
		- Selection process is opaque and subject to (sub)conscious bias.

	- Programming Challenge

		Advantages:
		- Useful for themed hackathons or 

		Disadvantages:
		- Similarly to Applications method, high barrier to entry
			- Daunting to first-timers / beginners especially if they don't feel qualified.


### Things worth Noting

- Accessibility to various groups 
	- Individuals from groups under-represented in technology
	- Those with special needs or requiring special accommodations

# Venue

nothing here yet

---

# Volunteers

The *lifeblood* of any event: without their commitment and effort - even the best laid plans go to waste.  So how do you aim to achieve that?  

### Building the Team

- Choose your core team for specific roles and let them pick their teams.  From there trust them to execute the decisions made and not micro-manage.  
  - Always offer your support 
- Getting volunteers to feel involved in the planning of the event
  - People will feel invested in an event if they feel their opinions matter in the grand scheme of things
  - Keep them in the loop of whats going on (ensuring relevance) and not constantly lost


### Kept in the Loop

Speaking of being kept in the loop - with the wealth of information available, how do you keep track of everything?  Here are some ways:

- Slack
  - Full Team Discussions
  - Announcements of issues / news the team needs to be aware of.
- Google Drive
  - Centralised repository for files
  - Meeting minutes, spreadsheets to keep track of budgets etc.
- Trello
  - Can act as a summary of tasks.  Easy to see at a glance what needs to be done by when.
- Regular team meetings
  - Things can move very quickly, and with Slack firing fast and furious people can lose track of what's going on.  Having regular team meetings can keep different teams up-to-date on what progress is like.  Other topics include issues teams might be facing and upcoming issues teams will need to work on together.
  - Allow everyone to attend these meetings but make it mandatory for the relevant teams involved.  This goes back to building a sense of investment in the volunteers.  Unless there is a need, full team meetings should be held sparingly.


### Volunteer Schedule

Instead of ad hoc deciding who should be doing what on the day itself, why not plan beforehand and assign volunteers specific tasks / roles on day?  Having a schedule that determines who should be where at a given point of time during the event will reduce the chaos you have to deal with on the day.  This should *act as a guide* where people should be, unless more people are needed for a specific task.

- Check what times your Volunteers are available at - not everyone can be at the event 24/7. Even if they can they might wander off just because.
- Try to assign volunteers to the same tasks they've worked on before.  This ensures those with an intimate knowledge of what needs to be done in a specific role are responsible for it.
- Schedule shift changes around things occurring. E.g. preparing for a meal / event / workshop or tidying up the Sleeping Rooms before / after.
- Rest is important, make sure that every volunteer gets sufficient rest during the event. Lack of sleep hinders people from quick decision-making.  {{NB: see more in On-Day Execution Volunteers: Enforcing}}
- If changes need to be made to the schedule:
 - How quickly can you update the Volunteer Schedule
 - How long before the change is disseminated


### Team Briefing

- Done a week / few days before the event
  - Covers the responsibilities they've been assigned to in the [Volunteer Schedule]()
  - Covering the Code of Conduct and acceptable behaviour
  - Walkthrough of the venue, rooms and their purposes.  Resolving any issues that may arise or answering questions / doubts.
- Will you be using walkie-talkies during your event?  If yes, the team should know about radio etiquette.  While a joke or two can be funny, constant unecessary radio chatter is annoying.

# WiFi

### Bandwidth, Leases and Filtering

- Number of devices?
	- Multiply expected total no. of people on-site by 2.5 as a rough count of number of devices.
- Number of available leases?
	- Get number of Wifi Access Points's (APs) around the venue and leases available per AP (in practice).
	- Ask if the venue can provide additional infrastructure if no. of leases is less than the no. of devices.
- Bandwidth Capacity?  
	- Venue's maximum bandwidth possible?


- Network throttling / Port filtering?
	- Port Filtering done by the venue?  [The Hack Day Manifesto](http://hackdaymanifesto.com#network "The Hack Day Manifesto") has a good list of ports to keep unfiltered
		- TL:DR SSH (22)
		- DNS (53 — TCP & UDP)
		- VPN (47, 500, 1701, 1723, 5500)
		- HTTP (80)
		- NTP (123 — UDP)
		- HTTPS (443)
		- Submissions (587)
		- IMAPS (993)
		- MQTT (1883)
		- CVS (2401)
		- Subversion (3690)
		- XMPP/Jabber (5222)
		- Git (9418)
	- IP Whitelisting on venue's side for various sites to download software
	- Any Distrbuted Denial of Service  measures venue's infrastructure might have that will affect the hackathon?


### Wifi Failover

- Failover Planning
	- What happens if WiFi goes down, are there ethernet ports available? 
		- Are the ethernet ports MAC Address specific?  
		- Are the ethernet ports on the same IP segment as WiFi?
		- Where are the ethernet ports located?

- How long till the failover is available?
	- How do you communicate to attendees the downtime.
	- What do attendees have to do to conenct to the failover.


### On-Site Support

- On-site Support
	- Anyone from venue's Network Admin team around on-site if something happens?
	- (optional) Access to live information about how much bandwidth has been used and which protocols?  Done via SNMP Traps of the Wifi AP's


### External Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

- External ISP Providers?
