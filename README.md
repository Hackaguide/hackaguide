# Preface

Welcome to Hackaguide and the wondrous world of hackathon organising!  We've attempted to document many of the options available to you while organising a hackathon.  

Please note this is still a very rough work in progress, with only the Pre-Event section being completed at the moment.

As mentioned, Hackaguide attempts to document many of the issues you'll face before, during and after the hackathon.  While you're more than welcome to cover the whole guide, we suggest that you cherry-pick sections you're interested in / unsure about.  To that end, the guide is split into the following segments:

- Preface (You're here aren't you?)
- Pre-Event
	- As mentioned earlier, this is more of a documentation and less a baseline.  So while a lengthy read, don't be intimidated by it.  The content is to show you the many choices available and reasons why you would want to pick one over the others.  
	- Segmented by topic for easy reference, feel free to skip to specific chapters you're interested in / unsure about.
- On-Day Execution
	- A more concise version of Pre-Event focused on execution.
	- Topics here assume you've covered the same topic in Pre-Event.  Additional things to look out for while executing / implementing decisions and managing organised chaos are included.
- Post-Event
	- Things you'll want to prepare for after your event is done
- Optional
	- Stuff that you **shouldn't** approach until you're confident that you've covered the essentials / core.  This stuff can be woolly, headache-worthy and occasionally raise your internal caffeine pressure sky-high.  *Approach with significant caution.*

*In each section, we sometimes make assumptions - which are clearly stated - mostly around 24-hour long hackathons.  But be aware deviations can and will take place.*

We hope you have as much fun organising a hackathon as much as we had running ours!
