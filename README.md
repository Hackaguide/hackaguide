So you'd like to organize a hackathon!  Thats a huge step and we'd like to welcome you to the wonderous world of hackathon organising and managing organised chaos.  We all organize hackathons for different reasons, and while bigger and better seems appealing - so is the joy of building a community that facilitates the meeting of like-minded people to share ideas and build awesome projects!  That reason will influence some of the key decisions you will make while organizing the event!

This guide should cover many of the issues you'll face before, during and after the hackathon and help make for an overall smoother attendee experience.  The guide is split into the following segments:

- Preface (You're here aren't you?)
- Pre-Planning
	- This is a fairly lengthy read, but please don't be intimidated by it.  Much of the content is to give you an idea of the various choices available and reasons why you would want to pick one over the others.  
	- Segmented by topic for easy reference, feel free to skip to specific chapters as you require.
- On-Day Execution
	- A more concise version of Pre-Planning
	- The topics here duplicate Pre-Planning **but** assume you've read the same chapter in Pre-Planning.  The focus here will be on operations during the event and executing / implementing decisions you've made during Pre-Planning.
- Post-Event
	- Things you'll want to do after your event is done
- Optional
	- Stuff that you **shouldn't** approach until you're confident that you've covered the essentials / core.  This stuff can be woolly, headache-worthy and occassionally raise your internal caffeine pressure sky-high.  *Approach with significant caution.*


Let us repeat again: Hackathon Organising isn't too difficult, have fun and enjoy yourself while doing it.  This guide is long but mainly because we wanted to cover as much detail as possible to make life easy for our lovely readers!  We hope you have as much fun running a hackathon as we had running ours!
