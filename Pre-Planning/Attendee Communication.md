name: Attendee Communication

How do you let your attendees know whats going on?  With so many events and workshops happening, you'll want attendees to be aware of whats going on.  This can be done during Pre-Event and On-day, we've included some of the possible methods you might want too consider below.

Welcome Pack

The guide you make for your participants!  This is really helpful to let your attendees know what to expect beforehand and conveniently centralising information.

Volunteer Helpdesk
---

The Volunteer Helpdesk acts as a central point of contact between Organisers, Volunteers, Sponsors and Attendees.  Aware of whats going on in the hackathon their responsibilities include:
	- Answering questions on Slack, Social Media (Facebook, Twitter)
	- Answering questions on-site	
	- Directing people to the right mentors and vice-versa.
	- Making announcements on Slack for food, workshops, activities etc.

This reduces a fair bit of redundancy, and gives you a dedicated team toward handling communications - volunteers don't have to worry about too much overlap.
