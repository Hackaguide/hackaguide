name: Attendee Communication
---

How do you let your attendees know what's going on?  With so many events and workshops happening, you'll want attendees to be aware of what's going on.  This can be done during Pre-Event and On-day, we've included some of the possible methods you might want to consider below.


---
Welcome Pack
---

The guide you make for your participants!  This is really helpful to let your attendees know what to expect beforehand and conveniently centralising information for your attendees.  Information you may like to put in the Welcome Pack include:
	- Venue-related: Floor plans, fire exits, building access and how to get to the venue
	- Overall Schedule
	- Workshop Specific Schedule
	- Wifi Details
	- Food Menu and Meal Times
	- Challenges
	- Prizes
	- Sponsors

Things worth noting:

- If the Welcome Pack is available on your website, be ready to quickly upload the edited Welcome Pack.  You don't want attendees missing out on workshops / events they want to attend.
- Attendees sometimes forget to list down their food intolerances / allergies.  Being able to see the food menu makes them more likely to reach out and let you know beforehand.

Volunteer Helpdesk
---

Plan to setup a Volunteer Helpdesk at an easily accessible location in your event.  The Volunteer Helpdesk should act as the main point of contact between Organisers, Volunteers, Sponsors and Attendees.  Aware of what's going on in the hackathon its' responsibilities include:
	- Answering questions on Slack, Social Media (Facebook, Twitter)
	- Answering questions on-site	
	- Directing people to the right mentors and vice-versa.
	- Making announcements on Slack for food, workshops, activities etc.

Having a dedicated team for handling such communications helps reduce redundancy and allows other volunteers to focus on their specific roles.  However do ensure the rest of the team knows what's going on.

Volunteers
---

You and your volunteers will be engaging with the attendees throughout the event, for more details check out the {{Volunteer Section}}.


---
Slack
---

Ahhh, the ubiquitous [[omnipresent?]] Slack.  For the uninitiated, Slack is a messaging and collaboration system for teams.  Its' many service integrations can be quite helpful for a variety of reasons like:
	- Announcements for food, workshops / mini-events / talks and other cool stuff.
	- Event-specific bot created specifically to answer questions like where different rooms are, sponsor challenges and schedule amongst others. [1]
	- Sponsor-specific channels.  Discussions, Q&A, sponsor specific announcements can all be done here.
	- Spotify Integration?  If you've got a Spotify playlist playing, attendees can add to it.  (Make sure the music doesn't breach your Code of Conduct though)

While nothing really beats on-day human interaction, Slack is a good way to get pre-Event hype going.  By inviting attendees and sponsors onto the Event Slack early on, everyone can talk to each other and get to know more about the event and its sponsors.


---
Signage
---

How else do attendees find out where to go?  For places like the food area, hacking spaces, talks / events or sleeping rooms - **clear** directions to getting there is important.  Nothing is more frustrating than being lost in an unfamiliar environment.

- Scout your venue and get an estimate of how many signs need to be printed
	- Make sure the signs are frequent enough so people aren't too confused 
	- Check if the venue's walls are easily damaged by sticky-tape / blu-tack
- Large enough print and simple fonts so they can be easily spotted from afar.


---
Announcements
---

- Is there a Public Announcement System in the venue?
	- Microphones - Wired / Wireless?
	- Does the PA System reach throughout the hacking spaces?
