# Schedule

Having an overall event schedule is helpful, but be aware that delays *will* occur and you'll need to adjust for them.

### Event Schedule

This schedule provides information about what events / workshops are taking place at what time.  That is unless you're keeping it a surprise.  Below is a table of ways to make the event schedule available, ordered by update speed (fastest to slowest)

| Method of Delivery | Visibility | Update Speed |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Live Ticker (See [Optional](kpchi.github.io/hackaguide/Optional "Optional")) | If in central location, High | Faster |
| Website | High | Faster |
| Welcome Pack | Medium | Fast |
| Poster | High (until outdated) | Not possible |
| Welcome Booklet | High (until outdated) | Not possible |

Things worth Noting:
- Having a full event schedule and an event/workshop-only schedule can be useful.  Just remember both need to be updated!
- When planning your provisional schedule, add a small amount of buffer time.  This helps reduce the amount of adjusting you'll do on-day


### Volunteer Schedule

This is the full schedule where you'll detail what roles volunteers are assigned and where they should be. For more details, check out the [Volunteer Section](kpchi.github.io/hackaguide/Volunteers.html#Schedule "Volunteer Section").
