Things worth noting:  

- Don't be afraid to experiment!  Yes some foods are hit or miss, but its worth going beyond just the usual local norms like pizza, burritos, noodles, pies etc.
- List all the tasty food you are providing on the Attendee Welcome Pack!  Hackers are more likely to let you know about their allergies!
- Don't load up on just carbs, hackers are humans too!  Be nice and provide some healthy, nutritious food to sustain them.
- Make sure the food team has accounted for the various dietary requirements and allergies!  People doing ticketing should talk to the food team.
	- Various allergies (Especially peanut)
	- Halal, Kosher
	- Vegetarian, Vegan
	- Lactose Intolerant
	- Gluten-Free
- Make sure you have a list of stores / wholesalers near you, their opening & closing times and roughly what they carry!  This is especially helpful for restocking or for buying meals for vegetarian, vegan, lactose intolerant, gluten-free attendees.  If you have a low number of them, someone could simply head out to get food for them.

Mealtime Release
---

Ahh the sight of a hungry horde of hackers going for food is often an intimidating one.  How do you release food making sure everyone gets a fair share and that they don't queue too long for food, a hungry hacker = grumpy hacker!
<br >  
To that effect, the batch release system usually works well.  Determining the batches (range of table numbers, location in hacking space or some other automagical way) and reducing them to a manageable number is up to you!  Below is an example you might find useful, but use what works for you!

- Sponsors, Guest Judges first (before specified meal time begins)
- Call the batch!  Make sure the volunteers know the wristband identification system, allowing them to direct attendees with allergies or dietary requirements to the right section.
- Wait (X) Minutes before calling the next batch
- Repeat the last 2 steps until all attendees have gotten food
- Finally, Volunteers grab food
- Release for seconds to everyone if there is spare.

- Consider having volunteers distributing the portions, instead of attendees taking as much as they want.

- Wristband Identification:
	- X Color for Vegetarians, Vegans, Halal
	- Various other colors or one color for Lactose Intolerant, Gluten-Free and allergies.

- Consider keeping non-vegetarian and vegetarian options separate.

- Have labels in front of the food describing it, this reduces any confusion attendees might have and volunteers won't have to repeatedly answer the same question.

Snacks & Drinks

And here come the nibbles and elixirs of life that keep hackers sustained when all else has passed.  Hackers need energy to sustain when they're working and staying up all-night, so remember to get high-energy items!  But that doesn't mean only providing Redbull, there are high-energy fruits as well like bananas and pears.  Below is a list of things you can consider.

- Snacks
	- Fruits (Bananas, Apples, Pears, Tangerines)
	- Granola Bars
	- Nuts
	- Candy (Gummy Bears, Lollipops, Mars Bars and the like)
	- Crisps
	- Biscuits

- Drinks
	- Convenience here is key
	- Soda cans rather than 1.5L bottles with cups
	- Redbull (See Sponsors Section) / Energy Drink
	- Water bottles (500ml)
	- Coffee, Tea, Hot Chocolate
	- Milk (Dairy and Soy)

- Method of Delivery
	- Snacks available at fixed locations
		- Requires regular restocking (see Restocking Schedule)
		- No way to control how much each hacker takes (See [Optional](index.html/#section-Optional "Optional"))
	- Snacks available on regular rounds
		- Snacks go on rounds every so often
		- Possible that one or more carts required to prevent snacks that round from running out.
		- Volunteers can interact more with attendees!
	- Snacks available via KurtCart (Delivery on tweet) [Idea stolen from StudentHack]		
		- Requires tables to have fixed numbers + venue map with table numbers.
		- Requires for active social media monitoring and specific assigned volunteers.
		- Allows for a more joyful atmosphere with the feeling of a catered to service.  Also volunteers can interact more with attendees!

- Things worth noting:
	- Having a variety of food is nice to have if possible.
	- Add healthy snacks in like nuts, (dried) fruit or granola bars!  
	- Have water, lots of it.  Caffeine is fun and all, but it's also dehydrating.  And rather than let attendees get even more dehydrated by ingesting more, water always helps!
	- Have more than 1 kettle available if you're providing hot water / beverages / pot noodles.

Restocking Schedule
---

- Dependent on the method of delivery, fixed locations can be regularly restocked or restocked as required.  Regular rounds and the KurtCart can be restocked when the round is finished.
- Debate between regular restock and restocking as required, and regulating restocks.
	- **Budget dependent**, how much can you afford to release each restock and how much buffer budget do you have left?
	- **Regulating** before and after meals (See [Optional](index.html#section-Optional "Optional"))

Rubbish Collection
---

A necessity at hackathons, considering how much consumables attendees go through during the entire event.  Tables have occassionally become a landfill just from Coke cans alone.
<br>  
It's worth doing them every hour or two, and make sure the bin bags you've purchased aren't too flimsy.  Having a mix of shudderworthy contents spill all over you is a surefire way to spoil an otherwise good hackathon.
<br>  
Which is also a good reason to get hand sanitiser and disposable gloves!
