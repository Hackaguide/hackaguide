Things worth noting:
- Don't be afraid to experiment!  Yes some foods can be hit or miss, but its worth going beyond just the usual pizza, burritos, noodles, pies etc.
- List what food is being provided on the Attendee Welcome Pack!  Hackers will be more likely to let us know about their allergies!
- Don't load up on just carbs, hackers are humans too!  Be nice and provide some healthy, nutritious food to sustain them
- Make sure the food team has accounted for the various dietary requirements!

	- Half/quarter of attendees depending on event size

	- Finally, Volunteers grab food

- Consider having volunteers distributing the portions, instead of attendees taking as much as they want.

- Wristband Identification:

- Snacks
	- 

- Drinks
	- Convenience here is key
	- Soda cans rather than 1.5L bottles with cups, Water bottles (500ml)


/********Restocking Schedule********/
- Debate between hourly restock and restocking as it runs out, also regulating restocks
	- Budget dependent, how much can you afford to release each restock and how much buffer budget do you have left?
	- 

- Regulating before and after meals
	- Restock less an hour before meals
	- No restock an hour after meals

- Things worth considering
	- Staggering food and drinks restock, or doing both at the same time


Things worth noting:
- Variety of foods
- Healthy food and snacks
- Lots of water

Thus when coaches to various hackathons were killed, there was a huge outcry as precedent had been set and people 'expected' it to be there.

	Similarly this applies to swag,
