Things worth noting:  

- Don't be afraid to experiment!  Yes some foods are hit or miss, but its worth going beyond just the usual pizza, burritos, noodles, pies etc.
- List all the tasty food you are providing on the Attendee Welcome Pack!  Hackers are more likely to let you know about their allergies!
- Don't load up on just carbs, hackers are humans too!  Be nice and provide some healthy, nutritious food to sustain them
- Make sure the food team has accounted for the various dietary requirements!  People doing ticketing should talk to the food team.
	- Various allergies
	- Halal
	- Vegetarian, Vegan
	- Lactose Intolerant
	- Gluten-Free
- Note down stores / wholesalers near you, their opening / closing times and roughly what they carry!  This is especially helpful for restocking or for vegetarian, vegan, lactose intolerant, gluten-free attendees.  If you have a low number of them, someone could simply head out to get food for them.

Mealtime Release
---

Mealtime release, ahh the sight of a hungry horde of hackers going for food is often an intimidating one.  How do you release food making sure everyone gets a fair share.  That and making sure they don't queue too long for food, a hungry hacker = grumpy hacker!
<br >  
To that effect, the batch release system usually works well for us.  Determining the batches (range of table numbers, location in hacking space or some other automagical way) to a manageable number is up to you!  Below is an example you might find useful, but use what works for you!

- Sponsors, Guest Judges first (before specified meal time begins)
- Vegetarians, Vegans, Halal, Gluten-Free, Lactose-Intolerant
- Wait (X) Minutes before calling the next batch
- Call the batch!
- Wait (X) Minutes before calling the next batch
- Repeat the last 2 steps until all attendees have gotten food
- Finally, Volunteers grab food
- Release for seconds if there is spare.

- Consider having volunteers distributing the portions, instead of attendees taking as much as they want.

- Wristband Identification:
	- Green for Vegetarians, Vegans, Halal
	- Various other colors or one color for Lactose Intolerant, Gluten-Free and allergies.

	- Water bottles (500ml)
	- Coffee, Tea, Hot Chocolate
	- Milk (Dairy and Soy)

- Method of Delivery
	- Snacks available at fixed locations

Restocking Schedule
---

- Debate between hourly restock and restocking as required, and regulating restocks
	- Budget dependent, how much can you afford to release each restock and how much buffer budget do you have left?
	- 

- Regulating before and after meals
	- Restock less an hour before meals
	- No restock an hour after meals

- Things worth considering
	- Staggering food and drinks restock, or doing both at the same time


Things worth noting:
- Variety of foods
- Healthy food and snacks
- Lots of water

Controversial
---

- **Attendee Entitlement**  
	This is fairly controversial, cover the basics first.
	<br>  
	The easiest introduction to this topic is having MLH Coaches to various hackathons.  Once introduced, many people never considered the cost of bailing out of it last minute and never showed.  Despite measures taken to let hackers know that such decisions had a financial cost and reduce attrition - not much progress were made.  Thus when coaches to various hackathons were killed, there was a huge outcry as precedent had been set and people 'expected' it to be there.

	Similarly this applies to swag.
