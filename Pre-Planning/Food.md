Things worth noting:  

- Don't be afraid to experiment!  Yes some foods can be hit or miss, but its worth going beyond just the usual pizza, burritos, noodles, pies etc.
- List all the tasty food you are providing on the Attendee Welcome Pack!  Hackers will be more likely to let you know about their allergies!
- Don't load up on just carbs, hackers are humans too!  Be nice and provide some healthy, nutritious food to sustain them
- Make sure the food team has accounted for the various dietary requirements!  People doing ticketing should talk to the food team.

Controversial
---

- **Attendee Entitlement**  
	This is fairly controversial, cover the basics first.
	<br>  
	The easiest introduction to this topic is having MLH Coaches to various hackathons.  Once introduced, many people never considered the cost of bailing out of it last minute and never showed.  Despite measures taken to let hackers know that such decisions had a financial cost and reduce attrition - not much progress were made.  Thus when coaches to various hackathons were killed, there was a huge outcry as precedent had been set and people 'expected' it to be there.

	Similarly this applies to swag.
