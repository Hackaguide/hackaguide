# Ticketing

Please note this guide is Eventbrite First-Come First-Served (FCFS)-centric, there are some theoretical aspects here worth taking note of.  See Debatable.

### Pre-registration

- To gain quick idea of interest before actually releasing tickets.
- Allows an idea on priority release for certain groups if needed.


### Ticket Release

ASSUMPTION: FCFS ticket style only via Eventbrite. See Alternative Methods for some other alternative ticketing methods.

- Release tickets about 6 weeks before the event
- Multiple small batches, this keeps up the hype
	- Keep a rotation of ticket releases:
		E.g.: Monday 1pm, Tuesday 3pm, Wednesday 4pm, Thursday 7pm, Friday 8pm.  This ensures the different segments are taken care of and people don't feel like they've been excluded.
	- Ticket releases are announced via the Mailing List - this ensures people sign up to the mailing list and increases the 'hook' for (potential) attendees to keep track of whats going on in the newsletter / Mailing List.
- Ensure that only 1 ticket can be purchased, not multiple at once.  Will be a nightmare for Registration if multiple purchases are allowed.  

- Below are some Custom Questions you might want to ask amongst others:
	- Any allergies, dietary requirements you need to be aware of?
	- Any special requirements? (Medical, Accessibility)
	- Are you Under-18? (This assumes you're allowing U-18s to participate)
	- Do you have access to EduRoam / {X University Network}
	- First-time hackathon attendee?

### Access Codes

- Usually meant to be for:
	- Beginners
	- Individuals from groups under-represented in technology
	- Those with special needs or requiring special accommodations
	- For University-specific groups
		- Keep an active eye out on universities with only 1 or 2 students attending.  Ask them if they have friends who would like to come and provide enough tickets for them to form a team.


### Waitlist

- Give people on the waitlist 24 hours to respond.
- 3 days before the event, it would be better to prioritise people local or close to your hackathon (low travel costs)
- Consider giving a ticket to attendees on the waitlist who email / message asking for a ticket as they're more likely to come.

NOTE: Eventbrite has a weird bug where tickets released to waitlisted people are claimed but not taken off the waitlist.


### Alternative Methods

- Type of ticket releases
	- First-Comme First-Served Ticketing

		Advantages:
		- Lowest barrier to entry of the 3 methods listed down.  Applicants simply log-on to Eventbrite at the specified time, purchase (a free) ticket and done.
		- Immediate and people can make plans straightaway
		- Using batch-based ticketing helps maintain the interest in the event
			- Also allows word to spread to non-insider groups.  However, this should be addressed during the initial batches to allow people traveling from afar to get cheap tickets.

		Disadvantages: 
		- Can become a case of who has the fastest internet speed / can click the fastest.
		- Unfriendly to disabled users, especially because of how fast tickets can go in FCFS.  Need to release tickets but without being seen to be 'targeting' them.
		- Effort required to cover all potential target audiences, i.e. rotating ticket releases

	- Randomized Pool

		Advantages:
		- Completely randomized from a pool
		- Usually for the university's own students

		Disadvantages:
		- Completely randomized from a pool
		- Needs to be done early to avoid attendees having to pay a high travel cost.

	- Applications

		Advantages:
		- For (softly) themed hackathons, if they're looking for people with experience in the field this will help narrow down to attendees with experience.
		- Helps successful applicants get jobs with companies
			- Their CV's / emails are sent out to sponsoring companies
			- Part of the recruitment clause in the sponsorship package
			- Applicants should be aware of this fact (Ethical issue: Data Privacy) 
		
		Disadvantages:
		- High barrier to entry.
			- Daunting to first-timers / beginners especially if they feel that they're disadvantaged for not having a CV / LinkedIn / GitHub
			- Questionable as to why are these questions (GitHub handle / LinkedIn / CV) required?   Organizers need to be upfront about what they are using this data for.  Sponsorship, recruitment or?
			- Note that having such information is not a substitute for on-day interaction with hackers.  But better than blanket recruitment emails where the click-in rate is low.
		- Especially for beginners or people without any programming experience, they will feel "they're not good enough"
		- Selection process is opaque and subject to (sub)conscious bias.

	- Programming Challenge

		Advantages:
		- Useful for themed hackathons or 

		Disadvantages:
		- Similarly to Applications method, high barrier to entry
			- Daunting to first-timers / beginners especially if they don't feel qualified.


### Things worth Noting

- Accessibility to various groups 
	- Individuals from groups under-represented in technology
	- Those with special needs or requiring special accommodations
