name: Ticketing
---

Please note this guide is Eventbrite-centric, there are some theoretical aspects here worth taking note of.  See Debatable.

---
Pre-registration
---

- To gain quick idea before actually releasing tickets
- Allows an idea on priority release for certain groups if needed.


---
Ticket Release
---

ASSUMPTION: First Come First Served (FCFS) ticket style only via Eventbrite. See Alternative Methods for some other alternative ticketing methods.

- Release tickets about 6 weeks before the event
- Multiple small batches, this keeps up the hype
	- Keep a rotation of ticket releases:
		E.g.: Monday 1pm, Tuesday 2pm, Wednesday 3pm, Thursday 4pm, Friday 5pm.  This ensures the different segments are taken care of and people don't feel like they've been excluded.
	- Ticket releases are announced via the Mailing List - this ensures people are signed up to the mailing list and increases the 'hook' for (potential) attendees to keep track of whats going on in the newsletter / Mailing List.
-  Ensure that only 1 ticket can be purchased, not multiple at once.  Nightmare for Registration if multiple purchases are allowed.

Access Codes
---

- Meant to be for specific groups / under-represented demographics
	- Women
	- First-timers
	- Technology Minorities
- For University-specific groups
	- Keep an active eye out on universities with only 1 or 2 students attending.  Ask them if they have friends who would like to come and provide enough tickets for them to form a team.



---
Waitlist
---

- 24hr response time is ideal
- Closed off for people beyond the local region, 3 days before the event.
- For attendees who email / message in asking for a ticket - would be better to release a ticket to them as they're more likely to come.

NOTE: Eventbrite has a weird bug where tickets released to waitlisted people are claimed but not taken off the waitlist.

Alternative Methods
---

- Type of ticket releases
	- FCFS Ticketing

		Advantages:
		- Lowest barrier to entry of the 3 methods listed down.  Applicants simply logon to Eventbrite at the specified time, purchase (a free) ticket and done.
		- Immediate and people can make plans straightaway
		- Batch based ticketing helps maintain the interest in the event
			- Also allows word to spread to non-insider groups.  However, this should be addressed during the initial batches to allow people travelling from afar to get cheap tickets.

		Disadvantages: 
		- Can become a case of who has the fastest internet speed
		- Disabled users unable to get ticket due to FCFS speed.  How to release tickets without 'targeting' them.

	- Randomized Pool

		Advantages:
		- Completely randomized from a pool
		- Usually for the university's own students

		Disadvantages:
		- Completely randomized from a pool

	- Applications

		Advantages:
		- For (softly) themed hackathons, if they're looking for people with experience in the field this will help narrow down to attendees with experience.
		- Helps successful applicants get jobs with companies
			- Their CV's / emails are sent out to sponsoring companies
			- Part of the recruitment clause in the sponsorship package
			- Applicants should be aware of this fact (Ethical issue) 
		
		Disadvantages:
		- High barrier to entry.
			- Daunting to first-timers / beginners especially if they feel that they're disadvantaged for not having a CV / LinkedIn / GitHub
			- Questionable as to why are these questions (GitHub handle / LinkedIn / CV) required?   Organizers need to be upfront about what they are using this data for.  Sponsorship, recruitment or?
			- Note that having such information is not a substitute for on-day interaction with hackers.  Better than blanket recruitment emails where the click-in rate is low.
		- Especially for beginners or people without any programming experience, they will feel "they're not good enough"
		- Selection process is opaque and subject to (sub)conscious bias.

	- Programming Challenge

		Advantages:
		- 

		Disadvantages:
		-

Things to Note
---

- Accessibility to various groups 
	- Reaching out to groups that cater to the disabled or the minority / ethnic groups. 
	- Gender diversity is an additional topic as well.
