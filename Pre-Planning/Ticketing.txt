Please note this guide is Eventbrite-centric, there are some theoretical aspects here worth taking note of.  See Debatable.

/********Ticket Release********/
ASSUMPTION: First Come First Served (FCFS) ticket style only via Eventbrite. See Debatable for some other alternative ticketing methods.

- Release tickets about 6 weeks before the event
- Multiple small batches, this keeps up the hype
	- Keep a rotation of ticket releases:
		E.g.: Monday 1pm, Tuesday 2pm, Wednesday 3pm, Thursday 4pm, Friday 5pm.  This ensures the different segments are taken care of and people don't feel like they've been excluded.
	- Ticket releases are announced via the Mailing List - this ensures people are signed up to the mailing list and increases the 'hook' for (potential) attendees to keep track of whats going on in the newsletter / Mailing List.
-  Ensure that only 1 ticket can be purchased, not multiple at once.  Nightmare for Registration.  


/********Access Codes********/
- Meant to be for specific groups (up North, gender diversity)
	- Gives equality to under-represented groups.



/********Waitlist********/
- 24hr response time is ideal
- Closed off for people beyond the local region, 3 days before the event.

Eventbrite has a weird bug where tickets released to waitlisted people are claimed but not taken off the waitlist.


/********Debatable********/
- Type of ticket releases
	- FCFS Ticketing

		Advantages:
		- Lowest barrier to entry of the 3 methods listed down.  Applicants simply logon to Eventbrite at the specified time, purchase (a free) ticket and done.
		- 

		Disadvantages: 
		Can become a case of who has the fastest internet speed

	- Randomized Pool

		Advantages:
		- Completely randomized from a pool
		- Usually for the university's own students

		Disadvantages:


	- Applications

		Advantages:
		- For (softly) themed hackathons, if they're looking for people with experience in the field this will help narrow down
		- Similar to US-based hackathons, successful applicant's CV's / emails can be sent out to sponsoring companies
			- Applicants should be aware of this fact (Ethical issue)
			- As part of the recruitment clause in the sponsorship package.

		Disadvantages:
		- High barrier to entry
		- Especially for beginners or people without any programming experience, they will feel "they're not good enough"
