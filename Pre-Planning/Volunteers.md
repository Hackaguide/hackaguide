# Volunteers

The *lifeblood* of any event: without their commitment and effort - even the best laid plans go to waste.  So how do you aim to achieve that?  

### Building the team

- Choose your core team for specific roles and let them pick their teams.  From there trust them to execute the decisions made and not micro-manage.  
  - Always offer your support 
- Getting volunteers to feel involved in the planning of the event
  - People will feel invested in an event if they feel their opinions matter in the grand scheme of things
  - Keep them in the loop of whats going on (ensuring relevance) and not constantly lost


### Team Briefing

- Done a week / few days before the event
  - Covers the responsibilities they've been assigned to in the [Volunteer Schedule]()
  - Covering the Code of Conduct and acceptable behaviour
  - Walkthrough of the venue, rooms and their purposes.  Resolving any issues that may arise or answering questions / doubts.


### Volunteer Schedule

- Assign volunteers who've worked on a specific area there again.  This ensures no loss of knowledge
- Rest is important, make sure that every volunteer gets sufficient rest during the event.  Lack of sleep hinders people from quick decision-making.  {{NB: see more in On-Day Execution Volunteers: Enforcing}}
