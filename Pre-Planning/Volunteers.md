# Volunteers

The *lifeblood* of any event: without their commitment and effort - even the best laid plans go to waste.  So how do you aim to achieve that?  

### Building the Team

- Choose your core team for specific roles and let them pick their teams.  From there trust them to execute the decisions made and not micro-manage.  
  - Always offer your support 
- Getting volunteers to feel involved in the planning of the event
  - People will feel invested in an event if they feel their opinions matter in the grand scheme of things
  - Keep them in the loop of whats going on (ensuring relevance) and not constantly lost


### Kept in the Loop

Speaking of kept in the loop - with the wealth of information available, how do you keep track of everything?  Here are some ways:

- Slack
  - Full Team Discussions
  - Announcements of issues / news the team needs to be aware of.
- Google Drive
  - Centralised repository for files
  - Meeting minutes, spreadsheets to keep track of budgets etc.
- Trello
  - Can act as a summary of tasks.  Easy to see at a glance what needs to be done by when.
- Regular team meetings
  - Things can move very quickly, and with Slack firing fast and furious people can lose track of what's going on.  Having regular team meetings can keep different teams up-to-date on what progress is like.  Other topics include barriers teams might be facing and upcoming issues teams will need to work on together.
  - Allow everyone to attend these meetings but make it mandatory for the relevant teams involved.  This goes back to building a sense of investment in the volunteers.  Unless there is a need, full team meetings should be held sparingly.


### Volunteer Schedule

The Volunteer Schedule is essentially 

- Try to assign volunteers to the same tasks they've worked on before.  This ensures those with an intimate knowledge of what needs to be done in a specific role are responsible for it.
- Schedule shift changes around things occurring. E.g. preparing for a meal / event / workshop or tidying up the Sleeping Rooms before / after.
- Rest is important, make sure that every volunteer gets sufficient rest during the event.  Lack of sleep hinders people from quick decision-making.  {{NB: see more in On-Day Execution Volunteers: Enforcing}}
- Volunteer's available timings
- Dissemination of the schedule and how quickly it can be updated


### Team Briefing

- Done a week / few days before the event
  - Covers the responsibilities they've been assigned to in the [Volunteer Schedule]()
  - Covering the Code of Conduct and acceptable behaviour
  - Walkthrough of the venue, rooms and their purposes.  Resolving any issues that may arise or answering questions / doubts.
