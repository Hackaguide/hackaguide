# Volunteers

The *lifeblood* of any event: without their commitment and effort - even the best laid plans go to waste.  So how do you aim to achieve that?  

### Building the Team

- Choose your core team for specific roles and let them pick their teams.  From there, trust them to execute the decisions made and not micro-manage.  
  - Always offer your support 
- Getting volunteers to feel involved in the planning of the event
  - People will feel invested in an event if they feel their opinions matter in the grand scheme of things
  - Keep them in the loop of whats going on (ensuring relevance) and not constantly lost


### Volunteer Schedule

The Volunteer Schedule is essentially 

- Check what times your Volunteers are available at - not everyone can be at the event 24/7.
- Try to assign volunteers to the same tasks they've worked on before.  This ensures those with an intimate knowledge of what needs to be done in a specific role are responsible for it.
- Schedule shift changes around things occurring. E.g. preparing for a meal / event / workshop or tidying up the Sleeping Rooms before / after.
- Rest is important, make sure that every volunteer gets sufficient rest during the event.  Lack of sleep hinders people from quick decision-making.  {{NB: see more in On-Day Execution Volunteers: Enforcing}}
- If changes need to be made to the schedule:
	- How quickly can you update the Volunteer Schedule
	- How long before the change is disseminated


### Pre-Event Team Briefing

- Done a week / few days before the event
  - Covers the responsibilities they've been assigned to in the [Volunteer Schedule]()
  - Covering the Code of Conduct and acceptable behaviour
  - Walkthrough of the venue, rooms and their purposes.  Resolving any issues that may arise or answering questions / doubts.
