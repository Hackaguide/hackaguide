                            <p><strong>ASSUMPTION</strong>: 24 Hour hackathon, starting Saturday Morning and ending Sunday evening.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturday: Breakfast (Optional, good to have)  </li>
<li>Saturday: Lunch  </li>
<li>Saturday: Dinner  </li>
<li>Sunday  : Midnight Meal  </li>
<li>Sunday  : Breakfast  </li>
<li>Sunday  : Lunch
<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
<p>Things worth noting:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t be afraid to experiment!  Yes some foods are hit or miss, but its worth going beyond just the usual pizza, burritos, noodles, pies etc.</li>
<li>List all the tasty food you are providing on the Attendee Welcome Pack!  Hackers are more likely to let you know about their allergies!</li>
<li>Don’t load up on just carbs, hackers are humans too!  Be nice and provide some healthy, nutritious food to sustain them</li>
<li>Make sure the food team has accounted for the various dietary requirements and allergies!  People doing ticketing should talk to the food team.<ul>
<li>Various allergies (Especially peanut)</li>
<li>Halal, Kosher</li>
<li>Vegetarian, Vegan</li>
<li>Lactose Intolerant</li>
<li>Gluten-Free</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note down stores / wholesalers near you, their opening &amp; closing times and roughly what they carry!  This is especially helpful for restocking or for buying meals for vegetarian, vegan, lactose intolerant, gluten-free attendees.  If you have a low number of them, someone could simply head out to get food for them.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="mealtime-release">Mealtime Release</h2>
<p>Ahh the sight of a hungry horde of hackers going for food is often an intimidating one.  How do you release food making sure everyone gets a fair share and that they don’t queue too long for food, a hungry hacker = grumpy hacker!
<br ><br>To that effect, the batch release system usually works well.  Determining the batches (range of table numbers, location in hacking space or some other automagical way) to a manageable number is up to you!  Below is an example you might find useful, but use what works for you!</p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsors, Guest Judges first (before specified meal time begins)</li>
<li>Vegetarians, Vegans, Halal, Gluten-Free, Lactose-Intolerant</li>
<li>Wait (X) Minutes before calling the next batch</li>
<li>Call the batch!</li>
<li>Wait (X) Minutes before calling the next batch</li>
<li>Repeat the last 2 steps until all attendees have gotten food</li>
<li>Finally, Volunteers grab food</li>
<li><p>Release for seconds to everyone if there is spare.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consider having volunteers distributing the portions, instead of attendees taking as much as they want.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wristband Identification:</p>
<ul>
<li>X Color for Vegetarians, Vegans, Halal</li>
<li>Various other colors or one color for Lactose Intolerant, Gluten-Free and allergies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="snacks-drinks">Snacks &amp; Drinks</h2>
<p>And here come the nibbles and elixirs of life that keep hackers sustained when all else has passed.  Hackers need energy to sustain when they’re working and staying up all-night, so remember to get high energy items!  But that doesn’t mean only providing Redbull, there are high-energy fruits as well like bananas and pears.  Below is a list of things you can consider.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Snacks</p>
<ul>
<li>Fruits (Bananas, Apples, Pears, Tangerines)</li>
<li>Granola Bars</li>
<li>Nuts</li>
<li>Candy (Gummy Bears, Lollipops, Mars Bars and the like)</li>
<li>Crisps</li>
<li>Biscuits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Drinks</p>
<ul>
<li>Convenience here is key</li>
<li>Soda cans rather than 1.5L bottles with cups</li>
<li>Redbull (See Sponsorship Section) / Energy Drink</li>
<li>Water bottles (500ml)</li>
<li>Coffee, Tea, Hot Chocolate</li>
<li>Milk (Dairy and Soy)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Method of Delivery</p>
<ul>
<li>Snacks available at fixed locations<ul>
<li>Requires regular restocking (see Restocking Schedule)</li>
<li>No way to regulate how much each hacker takes (See Controversial)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Snacks available on regular rounds<ul>
<li>Snacks go on rounds every so often</li>
<li>Possible that one or more carts required to prevent snacks that round from running out.</li>
<li>Volunteers can interact more with attendees!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Snacks available via KurtCart (Delivery on tweet) [Idea stolen from StudentHack]        <ul>
<li>Requires tables to have fixed numbers + venue map with table numbers.</li>
<li>Requires for active social media monitoring and specific assigned volunteers.</li>
<li>Allows for a more joyful atmosphere with the feeling of a catered to service.  Also volunteers can interact more with attendees!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Things worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a variety of food is nice to have if possible.</li>
<li>Add healthy snacks in like nuts, (dried) fruit or granola bars!  </li>
<li>Have water, lots of it.  Caffeine is fun and all, but is also dehydrating.  And rather than let them get even more dehydrated by ingesting more, water always helps!</li>
<li>Have more than 1 kettle available if you’re providing hot water / beverages / pot noodles.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="restocking-schedule">Restocking Schedule</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dependent on the method of delivery, fixed locations can be regularly restocked or restocked as required.  Regular rounds and the KurtCart can be restocked when the round is finished.</li>
<li>Debate between regular restock and restocking as required, and regulating restocks.<ul>
<li><strong>Budget dependent</strong>, how much can you afford to release each restock and how much buffer budget do you have left?</li>
<li><strong>Regulating</strong> before and after meals (See Controversial)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="rubbish-collection">Rubbish Collection</h2>
<p>A necessity at hackathons, considering how much consumables we go through during the entire event.  Tables have occassionally become a landfill just from Coke cans alone.
<br><br>It’s worth doing them every hour or two, and make sure the bin bags you’ve purchased aren’t too flimsy.  Having a mix of shudderworthy contents spill all over you is a surefire way to ruin an otherwise good weekend.
<br><br>Which is also a good reason to get hand sanitiser and disposable gloves!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="controversial">Controversial</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attendee Entitlement</strong><br>  This is fairly controversial, cover the basics first.
  <br><br>  The easiest introduction to this topic is having MLH Coaches to various hackathons.  Once introduced, many people never considered the cost of bailing out of it last minute and never showed.  Despite measures taken to let hackers know that such decisions had a financial cost and reduce attrition - not much progress were made.  Thus when coaches to various hackathons were killed, there was a huge outcry as precedent had been set and people ‘expected’ it to be there.
  <br><br>  Similarly this applies to swag.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regulating Restocks</strong><br>  Tricky subject, you’ve ordered food for your attendees but also provide snacks to them.  Do you regulate snacks so that your meals don’t go to waste or do you let attendees self-regulate their own eating habits?  </p>
<p>  Much of this is down to personal choice, </p>
<pre><code>  - Restock less an hour before meals
  - No restock during and an hour after meals
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

                            <p>Please note this guide is Eventbrite-centric, there are some theoretical aspects here worth taking note of.  See Debatable.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pre-registration">Pre-registration</h2>
<ul>
<li>To gain quick idea before actually releasing tickets</li>
<li>Allows an idea on priority release for certain groups if needed.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="ticket-release">Ticket Release</h2>
<p>ASSUMPTION: First Come First Served (FCFS) ticket style only via Eventbrite. See Alternative Methods for some other alternative ticketing methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Release tickets about 6 weeks before the event</li>
<li>Multiple small batches, this keeps up the hype<ul>
<li>Keep a rotation of ticket releases:
  E.g.: Monday 1pm, Tuesday 2pm, Wednesday 3pm, Thursday 4pm, Friday 5pm.  This ensures the different segments are taken care of and people don’t feel like they’ve been excluded.</li>
<li>Ticket releases are announced via the Mailing List - this ensures people are signed up to the mailing list and increases the ‘hook’ for (potential) attendees to keep track of whats going on in the newsletter / Mailing List.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure that only 1 ticket can be purchased, not multiple at once.  Nightmare for Registration if multiple purchases are allowed.  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="access-codes">Access Codes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Meant to be for specific groups / under-represented demographics<ul>
<li>Women</li>
<li>First-timers</li>
<li>Technology Minorities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For University-specific groups<ul>
<li>Keep an active eye out on universities with only 1 or 2 students attending.  Ask them if they have friends who would like to come and provide enough tickets for them to form a team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="waitlist">Waitlist</h2>
<ul>
<li>24hr response time is ideal</li>
<li>Closed off for people beyond the local region, 3 days before the event.</li>
<li>For attendees who email / message in asking for a ticket - would be better to release a ticket to them as they’re more likely to come.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Eventbrite has a weird bug where tickets released to waitlisted people are claimed but not taken off the waitlist.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="alternative-methods">Alternative Methods</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Type of ticket releases</p>
<ul>
<li><p>FCFS Ticketing</p>
<p>  Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowest barrier to entry of the 3 methods listed down.  Applicants simply logon to Eventbrite at the specified time, purchase (a free) ticket and done.</li>
<li>Immediate and people can make plans straightaway</li>
<li><p>Batch based ticketing helps maintain the interest in the event</p>
<ul>
<li>Also allows word to spread to non-insider groups.  However, this should be addressed during the initial batches to allow people travelling from afar to get cheap tickets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages: </p>
</li>
<li>Can become a case of who has the fastest internet speed</li>
<li>Disabled users unable to get ticket due to FCFS speed.  How to release tickets without ‘targeting’ them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Randomized Pool</p>
<p>  Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely randomized from a pool</li>
<li><p>Usually for the university’s own students</p>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
</li>
<li>Completely randomized from a pool</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Applications</p>
<p>  Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>For (softly) themed hackathons, if they’re looking for people with experience in the field this will help narrow down to attendees with experience.</li>
<li><p>Helps successful applicants get jobs with companies</p>
<ul>
<li>Their CV’s / emails are sent out to sponsoring companies</li>
<li>Part of the recruitment clause in the sponsorship package</li>
<li>Applicants should be aware of this fact (Ethical issue) </li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
</li>
<li>High barrier to entry.<ul>
<li>Daunting to first-timers / beginners especially if they feel that they’re disadvantaged for not having a CV / LinkedIn / GitHub</li>
<li>Questionable as to why are these questions (GitHub handle / LinkedIn / CV) required?   Organizers need to be upfront about what they are using this data for.  Sponsorship, recruitment or?</li>
<li>Note that having such information is not a substitute for on-day interaction with hackers.  Better than blanket recruitment emails where the click-in rate is low.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Especially for beginners or people without any programming experience, they will feel “they’re not good enough”</li>
<li>Selection process is opaque and subject to (sub)conscious bias.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Programming Challenge</p>
