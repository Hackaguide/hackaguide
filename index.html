<p>Things worth noting:  </p>

<li>Don’t be afraid to experiment!  Yes some foods can be hit or miss, but its worth going beyond just the usual pizza, burritos, noodles, pies etc.</li>
<li>List all the tasty food you are providing on the Attendee Welcome Pack!  Hackers will be more likely to let you know about their allergies!</li>
<li>Don’t load up on just carbs, hackers are humans too!  Be nice and provide some healthy, nutritious food to sustain them</li>

<h2 id="controversial">Controversial</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attendee Entitlement</strong><br>  This is fairly controversial, cover the basics first.
  <br><br>  The easiest introduction to this topic is having MLH Coaches to various hackathons.  Once introduced, many people never considered the cost of bailing out of it last minute and never showed.  Despite measures taken to let hackers know that such decisions had a financial cost and reduce attrition - not much progress were made.  Thus when coaches to various hackathons were killed, there was a huge outcry as precedent had been set and people ‘expected’ it to be there.
  <br><br>  Similarly this applies to swag.</li>

                            <p>Please note this guide is Eventbrite-centric, there are some theoretical aspects here worth taking note of.  See Debatable.</p>
<p>/<strong><em>**</em></strong>Pre-registration<strong><em>**</em></strong>/</p>
<ul>
<li>To gain quick idea before actually releasing tickets</li>
<li>Allows an idea on priority release for certain groups if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>/<strong><em>**</em></strong>Ticket Release<strong><em>**</em></strong>/
ASSUMPTION: First Come First Served (FCFS) ticket style only via Eventbrite. See Alternative Methods for some other alternative ticketing methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Release tickets about 6 weeks before the event</li>
<li>Multiple small batches, this keeps up the hype<ul>
<li>Keep a rotation of ticket releases:
  E.g.: Monday 1pm, Tuesday 2pm, Wednesday 3pm, Thursday 4pm, Friday 5pm.  This ensures the different segments are taken care of and people don’t feel like they’ve been excluded.</li>
<li>Ticket releases are announced via the Mailing List - this ensures people are signed up to the mailing list and increases the ‘hook’ for (potential) attendees to keep track of whats going on in the newsletter / Mailing List.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure that only 1 ticket can be purchased, not multiple at once.  Nightmare for Registration if multiple purchases are allowed.  </li>
</ul>
<p>/<strong><em>**</em></strong>Access Codes<strong><em>**</em></strong>/</p>
<ul>
<li>Meant to be for specific groups / under-represented demographics<ul>
<li>Women</li>
<li>First-timers</li>
<li>Technology Minorities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For University-specific groups<ul>
<li>Keep an active eye out on universities with only 1 or 2 students attending.  Ask them if they have friends who would like to come and provide enough tickets for them to form a team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>/<strong><em>**</em></strong>Waitlist<strong><em>**</em></strong>/</p>
<ul>
<li>24hr response time is ideal</li>
<li>Closed off for people beyond the local region, 3 days before the event.</li>
<li>For attendees who email / message in asking for a ticket - would be better to release a ticket to them as they’re more likely to come.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Eventbrite has a weird bug where tickets released to waitlisted people are claimed but not taken off the waitlist.</p>
<p>/<strong><em>**</em></strong>Alternative Methods<strong><em>**</em></strong>/</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Type of ticket releases</p>
<ul>
<li><p>FCFS Ticketing</p>
<p>  Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowest barrier to entry of the 3 methods listed down.  Applicants simply logon to Eventbrite at the specified time, purchase (a free) ticket and done.</li>
<li>Immediate and people can make plans straightaway</li>
<li><p>Batch based ticketing helps maintain the interest in the event</p>
<ul>
<li>Also allows word to spread to non-insider groups.  However, this should be addressed during the initial batches to allow people travelling from afar to get cheap tickets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages: </p>
</li>
<li>Can become a case of who has the fastest internet speed</li>
<li>Disabled users unable to get ticket due to FCFS speed.  How to release tickets without ‘targeting’ them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Randomized Pool</p>
<p>  Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely randomized from a pool</li>
<li><p>Usually for the university’s own students</p>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
</li>
<li>Completely randomized from a pool</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Applications</p>
<p>  Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>For (softly) themed hackathons, if they’re looking for people with experience in the field this will help narrow down to attendees with experience.</li>
<li><p>Helps successful applicants get jobs with companies</p>
<ul>
<li>Their CV’s / emails are sent out to sponsoring companies</li>
<li>Part of the recruitment clause in the sponsorship package</li>
<li>Applicants should be aware of this fact (Ethical issue) </li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
</li>
<li>High barrier to entry.<ul>
<li>Daunting to first-timers / beginners especially if they feel that they’re disadvantaged for not having a CV / LinkedIn / GitHub</li>
<li>Questionable as to why are these questions (GitHub handle / LinkedIn / CV) required?   Organizers need to be upfront about what they are using this data for.  Sponsorship, recruitment or?</li>
<li>Note that having such information is not a substitute for on-day interaction with hackers.  Better than blanket recruitment emails where the click-in rate is low.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Especially for beginners or people without any programming experience, they will feel “they’re not good enough”</li>
<li>Selection process is opaque and subject to (sub)conscious bias.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Programming Challenge</p>
<p>  Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disadvantages:</p>
