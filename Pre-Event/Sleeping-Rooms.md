# Sleeping Rooms

### Sleeping / Resting areas

Hackathons shouldn't be events of self-imposed torture (lack of sleep, post-hackathon illness, junk food overload etc).  So why not provide areas conducive to resting?  Here are some things to take note of:

- Do you have capacity for more than one sleeping rooms?  Do you have Under-18s present staying overnight?  If the answer to either is yes note:
	- Ideally have male, female and non-binary sleeping rooms.  If not, gender specific sleeping rooms while allowing non-binary attendees to make their choice also works.
	- If Under-18s are present overnight, ensure they have separate sleeping rooms. Background-Checked Volunteers should be stationed outside Under-18 specific sleeping rooms.
- Provide sleeping Bags / Yoga Mats / Air Beds (make sure you have an *electric* pump handy!) depending on your budget.  If not, asking attendees to bring their own is also a possibility. 
- Is it going to be cold during the event?
- Don't assume your sleeping areas will always be warm.
	- Ensure that room heating is active at night, and check if it adjustable or is controlled by central heating.
	- Provide or ask attendees to bring their own blankets.
	- Have portable heaters available (ensure it doesn't breach Fire Safety!  See [Venue](Pre-Event/Venue.md "Venue")).
- Air flow to introduce fresh air is important too!  Waking up to the sleeping room smelling like a locker room isn't always pleasant.

Beyond that, there are other things such as noise and light pollution as well as privacy to be aware of:

- Noise Pollution
	- Having heavy doors / curtains help block out some noise.
	- Keep sleeping areas away from main hacking spaces.
	- Avoid planning any mini-events near the sleeping area.
	- Make sleeping rooms **Mobile Phone Alarm-free Zones** (or any similar alarms).  Let attendees know, and have a sign up stating as such.
		- If you have manpower, you might station volunteers to help wake attendees up during the night hours (1am - 6am).  This is only if attendees specifically request for it.

- Light Pollution
	- Be aware of where sunlight can stream in - having curtains over windows is ideal.
	- Makeshift curtains work just as well!  

- Privacy
	- You wouldn't like it if someone was able to peek into your bedroom while you were sleeping.  Similarly, you should ensure resting attendees have such privacy.
	- Space out how you lay the mats!  We all have differing levels of personal space, and it wouldn't be fun to roll into another person at night.
