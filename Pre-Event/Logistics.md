# Logistics

Much of the guide is fundamentally about event logistics. However some the points raised here don't immediately relate to their parent topic or don't fit into any topic.  Hence the reason for creating a catch-all logistics topic.

- Clearly listing where stuff is stored.
- Tools / First Aid Kits and Equipment for re-supply.


### Furniture

### Power Supply

### Pre-Event / Workshop Preparation

- Ensure mic / projector / required equipment working and ready for plug-n-play.
- Setting up of furniture layout, making sure general cleanliness of area.


### Venue Cleanliness

- Waste Management
  
  A necessity at hackathons, considering the consumables attendees go through during the entire event.  Tables have occasionally become a landfill just from Coke cans alone.

  It's worth doing them every hour or two, and make sure the bin bags you've purchased aren't too flimsy.  Having a mix of shudder-worthy contents spill all over you is a surefire way to spoil an otherwise good hackathon.

  Which is also a good reason to get hand sanitiser and disposable gloves!
    
- Toilet Maintenance


### Fire Safety
