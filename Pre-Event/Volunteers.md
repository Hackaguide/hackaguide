# Volunteers

The *lifeblood* of any event: without their commitment and effort - even the best laid plans go to waste.  So how do you aim to achieve that?  This section will cover volunteer-related topics **Pre-Event**

### Building the Team

- Choose your core team for specific roles and let them pick their teams.  From there trust them to execute the decisions made and not micro-manage.  
  - Always offer your support.
- Getting volunteers to feel involved in the planning of the event.
  - People will feel invested in an event if they feel their opinions matter in the grand scheme of things.
  - Keep them in the loop of whats going on (ensuring relevance) and not constantly lost.


### Kept in the Loop

Speaking of being kept in the loop - with the wealth of information available, how do you keep track of everything?  Here are some ways:

- Slack
  - Full Team Discussions.
  - Announcements of issues / news the team needs to be aware of.
- Google Drive
  - Centralised repository for files.
  - Meeting minutes, spreadsheets to keep track of budgets etc.
- Trello
  - Can act as a summary of tasks.  Easy to see at a glance what needs to be done by when.
- Regular team meetings
  - Things can move very quickly, and with Slack firing fast and furious people can lose track of what's going on.  Having regular team meetings can keep different teams up-to-date on what progress is like.  Other topics include issues teams might be facing and upcoming issues teams will need to work on together.
  - Allow everyone to attend these meetings but make it mandatory for the relevant teams involved.  This goes back to building a sense of investment in the volunteers.  Unless there is a need, full team meetings should be held sparingly.


### Volunteer Schedule

Instead of ad hoc deciding who should be doing what on the day itself, why not plan beforehand and assign volunteers specific tasks / roles on day?  Having a schedule that determines who should be where at a given point of time during the event will reduce the chaos you have to deal with on the day.  This should *act as a guide* where people should be, unless more people are needed for a specific task.

- Check what times your Volunteers are available at - not everyone can be at the event 24/7. Even if they can they might wander off just because.
- Try to assign volunteers to the same tasks they've worked on before.  This ensures those with an intimate knowledge of what needs to be done in a specific role are responsible for it.
- Schedule shift changes around things occurring. E.g. preparing for a meal / event / workshop or tidying up the Sleeping Rooms before / after.
- Rest is important, make sure that every volunteer gets sufficient rest during the event. Lack of sleep hinders people from quick decision-making.  (Note: See more in [On-Day/Volunteers](On-Day-Execution/Volunteers.md))
- If changes need to be made to the schedule:
 - How quickly can you update the Volunteer Schedule.
 - How long before the change is disseminated.


### Team Briefing

- Done a week / few days before the event.
- Topics include:
  - Responsibilities they've been assigned to in the [Volunteer Schedule](Pre-Event/Volunteers.md#Volunteer-Schedule).
  - Emergency Plans (Fire or other emergencies)
  - Code of Conduct and acceptable behaviour.
  - Walkthrough of the venue, rooms and their purposes.  Resolving any issues that may arise or answering questions / doubts.
  - Radio Etiquette.  If you're using walkie-talkies during your event, this should be covered.  While a joke or two can be funny, unecessary radio chatter is annoying.
