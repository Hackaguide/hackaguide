### Choosing a Venue


### Preparing for the venue

You've gotten your venue!  Here are things you'll need to prepare before hand.  Note: You may have gotten most of these details while choosing your venue.

- Venue Layout
	- Rooms and Facilities available to you.

		Start designating a purpose for each room - Sleeping, Food, Main Hacking Area, Workshops etc.  That will allow you to plan out the equipment required in the room, and after comparing against equipment you have - purchase any additional equipment required.

		You should also note the number of electrical sockets available in each room.

	- Venue Map

		Having a map of the venue posted up around your event is a great way to show attendees where they are currently.  Just make sure you indicate where they are currently!

- Furniture layout.
	- Total amount required.
	- Cost (If you're hiring furniture).
	- Be aware of any Fire Code rules you should adhere to.
	- Fire Code

- Fire Safety and Emergency Exits

	- Ensure your Opening Ceremony / Welcome Session includes a section on **Emergency & Evacuation**.
